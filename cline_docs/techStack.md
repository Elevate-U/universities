# Tech Stack

## Data Storage
- CSV (`universitydata.csv`): Primary storage for university information.

## Frontend (Potential)
- HTML (`index.html`)
- CSS (`styles.css`)
- JavaScript (`script.js`)

## Backend (Potential)
- TBD (If a server-side application is developed)

## Architecture Decisions
- Currently a data-focused project with a simple static frontend.
- Data cleaning and manipulation are done directly on the CSV.
