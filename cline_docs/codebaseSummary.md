# Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions
- `universitydata.csv`: The core dataset containing information about various universities.
- `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`: Basic frontend structure for potentially displaying the university data. Interaction is currently manual (data needs to be loaded/parsed by script.js).

## Data Flow
- University data resides statically in `universitydata.csv`.
- Potential future flow: `script.js` reads/parses `universitydata.csv` to display in `index.html`.

## External Dependencies
- None explicitly defined yet.

## Recent Significant Changes
- Initial project setup.
- Creation of standard documentation files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`).
- Previous CSV formatting corrections (fixing triple-double-quotes and internal quotes).

## User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
- User identified incorrect data for specific universities in `universitydata.csv`, prompting the current data correction task.

## Additional Documentation References
- `cline_docs/update_csv_plan_v8.md`: (Seems like a planning document, potentially related to previous CSV updates).
