# Codebase Summary

## Key Components and Their Interactions
- `universitydata.csv`: The core dataset containing information about various universities.
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure. Contains the table (`#universityTable`) and details area (`#universityDetails`).
- `styles.css`: Basic styling for the page.
- `script.js`:
    - Fetches and parses `universitydata.csv` using PapaParse.
    - Stores university data in the `universities` array.
    - Stores food summaries (from RMP reviews) in the `foodSummaries` object.
    - Populates the main table (`#universityTable`) with university data.
    - Handles table sorting.
    - Displays detailed information (including RMP reviews, transportation, cost breakdown, links, and food summary) in `#universityDetails` when a table row is clicked (`displayDetails` function).
    - Includes helper functions for parsing, cost calculation, formatting, and hyperlinking.

## Data Flow
- University data resides statically in `universitydata.csv`.
- Food summary data is stored directly within `script.js` in the `foodSummaries` object.
- `script.js` reads/parses `universitydata.csv` and uses both CSV data and the `foodSummaries` object to populate `index.html`.

## External Dependencies
- PapaParse (CDN): Used for CSV parsing in `script.js`.

## Recent Significant Changes
- Initial project setup.
- Creation of standard documentation files (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`).
- Previous CSV formatting corrections (fixing triple-double-quotes and internal quotes).
- Corrected general CSV formatting (column misalignment, non-standard quoting) in `universitydata.csv`.
- Reviewed DePaul University transportation information and confirmed existing data is accurate.
- **Added Food Summary Feature:**
    - Added `foodSummaries` object to `script.js` containing text summaries for university dining experiences.
    - Modified `displayDetails` function in `script.js` to retrieve and display the relevant food summary in the details section.
- Corrected tuition display logic in `script.js` (`populateTable` and `displayDetails`) to consistently use the `Tuition` column value, removing special handling for Widener University.

## User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development
- User identified incorrect data for specific universities in `universitydata.csv`, prompting the previous data correction task.
- User requested the addition of a "Food" section, providing text summaries, leading to the current implementation.
- User noted incorrect tuition display for Widener University, leading to correction in `script.js`.
