# Plan for Updating the Website with Transportation Information

1.  **Data Extraction:** Extract relevant information from the search results for each university, focusing on the categories specified in the prompt (Public Transit, Campus Shuttles, Parking, Biking, Ride-Sharing, Airport Accessibility, Other Relevant Information).
2.  **Data Formatting:** Format the extracted information into a structured summary for each university, following the output format specified in the prompt (🚌 Public Transit, 🚗 Driving & Parking, 🚲 Cycling, 🚶 Walking, 🚕 Ride Sharing & Taxis, ✈️ Airport Access, 🚐 Campus Shuttles).
3.  **Data Cleaning and Validation:**
    *   **Review Quote Handling:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the CSV file to ensure consistent quote handling, especially for fields containing commas or other special characters.
    *   **Handle Missing Values:** Implement a strategy for handling missing values ("N/A" or empty fields) during data processing. Consider figuring out what the information is.
    *   **Correct Data Inaccuracies:** Verify and correct the inaccurate data points for the csv file. Use reliable external sources to obtain the correct information.
    *   **Remove Duplicate Entries:** Combine the duplicate entries for the universities listed above. to make sure all information is included.
    *   **Data Validation:** Implement data validation rules to ensure data quality and consistency. This could involve checking data types, ranges, and formats for each column, if it doesnt fit in it just think step by step to do make sure the website has all the information correctly, for example baylor universities total tuition is n/a even though it can do the math.
4.  **Create CSV Backup:** Create a backup copy of the original CSV file to ensure data is not lost in case of errors.
5.  **CSV Update:**
    *   Identify the rows in `universitydata.csv` corresponding to the universities.
    *   Add new columns to the CSV to accommodate the transportation information for each category.
    *   Populate the new columns with the formatted transportation summaries for each university.
6.  **CSV Validation:**
    *   Read the updated `universitydata.csv` file.
    *   Check for data integrity: Ensure that all new columns have been populated for the universities and that the data is consistent with the expected format.
    *   Report any validation errors.
7.  **Frontend Update:**
    *   Modify `script.js` to read the new transportation columns from `universitydata.csv`.
    *   Update `index.html` to display the transportation information for each university in a user-friendly format.
    *   Update `styles.css` to style the new transportation information sections in `index.html`.
8.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   Update `codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the changes made to the CSV and frontend files.
    *   Update `projectRoadmap.md` to track the progress of this task.
