# Current Task

## Objectives
- Add a new "Food" section to the university information website using the provided text summaries.
- Correct the display logic for Widener University's tuition to show the value from the `Tuition` column ($57,180) instead of calculating an average from `TuitionDisplay`.

## Context
- The user provided text summaries for the food section.
- The user noted that Widener University's tuition was displayed incorrectly (showing an average instead of the specific value).
- The `universitydata.csv` file contains the correct tuition value ($57,180) in the `Tuition` column.

## Completed Steps
- Added `foodSummaries` object to `script.js`.
- Modified `displayDetails` in `script.js` to show food summaries.
- Corrected `headerMap` in `script.js` to fix review/transportation data mismatch.
- Modified `populateTable` in `script.js` to display tuition from the `Tuition` column for all universities, removing the special average calculation for Widener.
- Modified `displayDetails` in `script.js` to display tuition from the `Tuition` column for all universities, removing the special average calculation for Widener.

## Next Steps
- Update `codebaseSummary.md` to reflect the tuition display logic change.
- Verify the changes on the website.
